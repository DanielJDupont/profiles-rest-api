Each model in django maps to a specific table in our database.
Django handles the entire relationship between our models and our database for us,
so we do not have to write SQL (sequel) statements directly.
Let's get started and create our first models for our project.

We have the user profile model.
We have a default user profile model that django provides.
We want to change the Django default model to use an email and not a username.

The project directory just contains configuration for our entire application.
Each app will have their own model.
The project directory does not contain models.
